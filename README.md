# Airline-Weather-Delays
Project 2 

## Proposal

As new employees at a travel agency, we have been asked to create a database that will allow the company to compare weather patterns and flight delays. The company wants to predict better how changing weather patterns over the year will impact travel plans in certain months. This information will better allow travel agents to plan trips for customers.
